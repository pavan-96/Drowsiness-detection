# Drowsiness-detection
## In this  Python project, we will be making a drowsiness detecting device. A great number of people drive on the highways'  day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep.
Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy.The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these mishaps' we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.
